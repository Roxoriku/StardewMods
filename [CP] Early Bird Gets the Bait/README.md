# Early Bird Gets the Bait
## Description
**Early Bird Gets the Bait** is a Content Patcher mod that utilizes the additional functionality added by Extra Animal Config to allow chickens (*and hopefully other animals in the future*) dig up bait throughout the day.

*Thank you Rabanoo for the idea.*

## Features
- Changed structure of data files
- Added config
- Can now toggle each chicken dig up item (none, bait, or bug meat)
- Can now set maximum amount to dig up each day (1-9) *Note that I don't know if they can ever actually reach 9 dig ups in a day*
